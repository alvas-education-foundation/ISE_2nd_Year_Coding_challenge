/*
1.This challenge will help you to learn how to take a character, a string and a sentence as input in C.

To take a single character  as input, you can use scanf("%c", &ch ); and printf("%c", ch) writes a character specified by the argument char to stdout


char ch;
scanf("%c", &ch);
printf("%c", ch);
This piece of code prints the character .

You can take a string as input in C using scanf(“%s”, s). But, it accepts string only until it finds the first space.

In order to take a line as input, you can use scanf("%[^\n]%*c", s); where  is defined as char s[MAX_LEN] where  is the maximum size of . Here, [] is the scanset character. ^\n stands for taking input until a newline isn't encountered. Then, with this %*c, it reads the newline character and here, the used * indicates that this newline character is discarded.

Note: After inputting the character and the string, inputting the sentence by the above mentioned statement won't work. This is because, at the end of each line, a new line character (\n) is present. So, the statement: scanf("%[^\n]%*c", s); will not work because the last statement will read a newline character from the previous line. This can be handled in a variety of ways and one of them being: scanf("\n"); before the last statement.

Task

You have to print the character, , in the first line. Then print  in next line. In the last line print the sentence, .

Input Format

First, take a character,  as input.
Then take the string,  as input.
Lastly, take the sentence  as input.

Output Format

Print three lines of output. The first line prints the character, .
The second line prints the string, .
The third line prints the sentence,

2.if and else are two of the most frequently used conditionals in C/C++, and they enable you to execute zero or one conditional statement among many such dependent conditional statements. We use them in the following ways:

if: This executes the body of bracketed code starting with  if  evaluates to true.

if (condition) {
    statement1;
    ...
}
if - else: This executes the body of bracketed code starting with  if  evaluates to true, or it executes the body of code starting with  if  evaluates to false. Note that only one of the bracketed code sections will ever be executed.

if (condition) {
    statement1;
    ...
}
else {
    statement2;
    ...
}
if - else if - else: In this structure, dependent statements are chained together and the  for each statement is only checked if all prior conditions in the chain are evaluated to false. Once a  evaluates to true, the bracketed code associated with that statement is executed and the program then skips to the end of the chain of statements and continues executing. If each  in the chain evaluates to false, then the body of bracketed code in the else block at the end is executed.

if(first condition) {
    ...
}
else if(second condition) {
    ...
}

else if((n-1)'th condition) {

else {

Task

Given a positive integer denoting , do the following:

If , then print the lowercase English word corresponding to the number (e.g., one for , two for , etc.).
If , print Greater than 9.
Input Format

The first line contains a single integer denoting .

Constraints

Output Format

If , then print the lowercase English word corresponding to the number (e.g., one for , two for , etc.); otherwise, print Greater than 9 instead.

    int n;
    scanf("%d",&n);

3.The fundamental data types in c are int, float and char. Today, we're discussing int and float data types.

The printf() function prints the given statement to the console. The syntax is printf("format string",argument_list);. In the function, if we are using an integer, character, string or float as argument, then in the format string we have to write %d (integer), %c (character), %s (string), %f (float) respectively.

The scanf() function reads the input data from the console. The syntax is scanf("format string",argument_list);. For ex: The scanf("%d",&number) statement reads integer number from the console and stores the given value in variable .

To input two integers separated by a space on a single line, the command is scanf("%d %d", &n, &m), where  and  are the two integers.

Task

Your task is to take two numbers of int data type, two numbers of float data type as input and output their sum:

Declare  variables: two of type int and two of type float.
Read  lines of input from stdin (according to the sequence given in the 'Input Format' section below) and initialize your  variables.
Use the  and  operator to perform the following operations:
Print the sum and difference of two int variable on a new line.
Print the sum and difference of two float variable rounded to one decimal place on a new line.
Input Format

The first line contains two integers.
The second line contains two floating point numbers.

Constraints

 integer variables 
 float variables 
Output Format

Print the sum and difference of both integers separated by a space on the first line, and the sum and difference of both float (scaled to  decimal place) separated by a space on the second line.


#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <math.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main()
{
int a,b,c,g;
    float d,e,f1,h;
    scanf("%d%d",&a, &b);
    scanf("%f%f",&d, &e);
    c=a+b;
    g=a-b;
    f1=d+e;
    h=d-e;
    printf("%d %d\n",c,g);
    printf("%.1f %.1f\n",f1,h);


   
    return 0;
}



4.Given a square matrix, calculate the absolute difference between the sums of its diagonals.

For example, the square matrix  is shown below:

1 2 3
4 5 6
9 8 9  
The left-to-right diagonal = . The right to left diagonal = . Their absolute difference is .

Function description

Complete the  function in the editor below. It must return an integer representing the absolute diagonal difference.

diagonalDifference takes the following parameter:

arr: an array of integers .
Input Format

The first line contains a single integer, , the number of rows and columns in the matrix .
Each of the next  lines describes a row, , and consists of  space-separated integers .

Constraints

Output Format

Print the absolute difference between the sums of the matrix's two diagonals as a single integer.


#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main() {
    int n;
    cin >> n;

    int arr[n][n];

    long long int d1=0; //First Diagonal
    long long int d2=0; //Second Diagonal

    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            cin >> arr[i][j];
            if (i == j) d1 += arr[i][j];
            if (i == n - j - 1) d2 += arr[i][j];
        }
    }

    cout << abs(d1 - d2) << endl; //Absolute difference of the sums across the diagonals
    return 0;
